An app I'm developing for note-taking and studying. Will have Quizlet-like functionality for studying notes, and each note will be able to be tagged with strings like authors, sources, subjects, etc.

Credits to [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) which I used to set up the front end.
